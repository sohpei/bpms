## What is Interoception?

Interoception refers to the sense of the internal physiological state of the body — such as heartbeat, breathing, temperature, or gut sensations. It underlies our ability to detect, interpret, and respond to signals from within our bodies.  

Research shows that interoceptive awareness is **strongly linked to emotional regulation, mental health, and decision-making**. According to the **Theory of Constructed Emotion (Barrett, 2017)**, emotions arise when the brain interprets bodily sensations in context:

> External situation → bodily signals → interpretation as emotion

For instance, a racing heart may be experienced as **anxiety** or **excitement**, depending on the situation.

## Language as a Window into Interoception

Language provides an accessible and powerful window into interoception.  
Phrases like *“my heart sank”* or *“my stomach turns”* reflect embodied experiences — how people perceive and communicate their bodily and emotional states.

This project explores how **everyday body-related language** reveals patterns of **embodiment and emotion** in large-scale natural language corpora.

We ask:  
> **How do people talk about their bodies in everyday language, and what does this reveal about emotion and well-being?**

## Body Part Mentions (BPMs)

We define **Body Part Mentions (BPMs)** as instances in text where words referring to body parts occur, such as:

- “I have a pain in my **chest**.”
- “He put his **hand** on my **shoulder**.”

BPMs serve as linguistic indicators of **embodied experience** — bridging physical sensation, emotional expression, and language.

## Datasets

We construct two novel corpora of body-related language:

- **TUSC<sub>BPM</sub>** — 6.9M tweets from the **TUSC** (Tweets from the US and Canada) dataset  
- **Spinn3r<sub>BPM</sub>** — 8.3K blog sentences from the **Spinn3r** web blog corpus  

These datasets enable quantitative investigations into how people use body-related words across **contexts, time, and regions**.
